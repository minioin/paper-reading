# How to Read Paper
- Author: S. Keshav <keshav@uwaterloo.ca>, David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo

## Study in three passes
### Birds-eye view [5-10 minutes]
- Read title, abstract and introduction
- Read all section and subsection headings
- Read the conclusions
- Glance over references, mentally ticking off ones you've already read.

Takeaway:
- Category (measurment, analysis, meta, research prototype, etc)
- Context (graph of all related papers, history, theories, etc)
- Correctness of the assumptions
- Contributions made by the paper
- Clarity and legibility of the paper

### Detailed Scan [1 hour]
Ignore proofs.
- Scan for unprofessionalism and signs of poorly written paper like shady figures, common mistakes, etc
- Make note of your own knowledge gaps and relevant papers to read

### Virtual Reimplementation of the paper [4-5 hours]
- make same assumptions as authors, re-create the findings and uncover its shortcomings and failings
- challenge every assumption in every sentence
- jot down ideas for future work


## Doing Literature Survey
- find **five recent papers** on given field using google scholar or citeseer and do one pass on each paper.
- Find a **surveyy pape**r: Go through each related works
- If you're unlucky, find shared citations and repeated author names in bibliography. These are **key papers and researchers** in that area.
- Download key papers and set them aside.
- Visit the websites of the key researchers and find their recent works. Identify **top conferences** from them.
- Go through each conferences and look through recent procedings to find **recent high-quality related works**.
- These paper and the key papers you set aside constitute the first version of your survey.
- Make two passes through these papers. If they all cite a key paper that you did not find earlier, obtain and read it, iterating as necessary.
